# Hurricane_Analysis
A Codecademy project to tidy and analyze data on hurricanes in the past years.
The goal of this project was to create functions, tidy, and analyze data on hurricanes. The project on Codecamey.com was also a test to see if I understood dictionary, functions, lists, return statements, parameters,and conditionals lessons.
